// OPERATOR PRECEDENCE: 

/* It tells us about the priority with which the operators will get evaluated.
   for example, if we have (a*8+b-c-2/7) so how will we get to know that which operator will
   be evaluated before?
   FOR THIS WE CAN GET PRECEDENCE TABLE FROM GOOGLE. WE DONT HAVE TO REMEBER THIS.
   And if we get multiple operators on same precedence or equal priority, then we will see ASSOCIATIVITY.
   ASSOCIATIVITY works from LEFT TO RIGHT. Yadi koi do ya do se zyada operators same precedence pe hai to
   wo left to right evaluate honge. Jo pehle aaega (moving from left to right) wo peehle evaluate hoga.*/
