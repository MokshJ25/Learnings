        arratives featuring Thor are most prominently attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears 
        throughout Norse mythology. In stories recorded in medieval Iceland, Thor bears at least fifteen 
        names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif and the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa. 
        With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered 
        Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, and he is the stepfather of 
        the god Ullr. Thor is the son of Odin and Jörð,[3] by way of his father Odin, he has numerous 
        brothers, including Baldr. Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot 
        pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (whom he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed 
        three dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the hammer Mjölnir, wears 
        the belt Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. Thor's 
        exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous 
        serpent Jörmungandr—and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—are recorded 
        throughout sources for Norse mythology.Into the modern period, Thor continued to be acknowledged in 
        folklore throughout Germanic-speaking Europe. 
        Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week Thursday bears his name 
        (modern English Thursday derives from Old English thunresdaeġ, 'Thunor's day'), and names 
        stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in 
        Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular 
        culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in Heathenry.
        Name
        The name Thor is derived from Norse mythology. Its medieval Germanic equivalents or cognates are Donar 
        (Old High German), Þunor (Old English), Thuner (Old Frisian), Thunar (Old Saxon), and Þórr (Old Norse),
        [4] the latter of which inspired the modern English form Thor.[5]

        Etymology
        Though Old Norse Þórr has only one syllable, it comes from an earlier Proto-Norse two-syllable form which 
        can be reconstructed as *Þonarr (from an earlier *Þunaraz) and/or *Þunurr (from *Þunuraz), evidenced by 
        the poems Hymiskviða and Þórsdrápa, and modern Elfdalian tųosdag 'Thursday', through the common Old Norse 
        development of the sequence -unr- to -ór-.[6]

        All Germanic forms of Thor's name descend from Proto-Germanic, but there is debate as to precisely what 
        form the name took at that early stage. The form *Þunuraz is suggested by Elfdalian tųosdag ('Thursday') 
        and by a runic inscription from around 700 from Hallbjäns in Sundre, Gotland, which includes the 
        sequence þunurþurus.[6]: 709–11  Alternatively, the form *Þunaraz is attractive because it is identical 
        to the name of the ancient Celtic god Taranus (by metathesis—switch of sounds—of an earlier *Tonaros, 
        attested in the dative tanaro and the Gaulish river name Tanarus).[7][8][6] Finally, the form *Þunraz 
        has also been suggested by Hjalmar Lindroth (1917) and has the attraction of clearly containing the 
        sequence -unr-, needed to explain the later form Þórr, although the similarity with Celtic theonym 
        *Tonaros is lost.[6]: 708  According to John T. Koch, the form *Þunraz is from earlier pre-Germanic 
        stage that predates Grimm's law.[9]
        These Proto-Germanic forms are probably further related to the common Proto-Indo-European root for 
        'thunder' *(s)tenh₂-, also attested in the Latin epithet Tonans (attached to Jupiter) and the Vedic 
        stanáyati ("thunders").[10] Scholar Peter Jackson argues that those theonyms may have emerged as the 
        result of the fossilization of an original epithet (or epiclesis, i.e. invocational name) of the 
        Proto-Indo-European thunder-god *Perkwunos, since the Vedic weather-god Parjanya is also called 
        stanayitnú- ('Thunderer').[11]
        The potentially perfect match between the thunder-gods *Tonaros and *Þunaraz, which both go back to 
        a common form *ton(a)ros ~ *tṇros, is notable in the context of early Celtic–Germanic linguistic contacts, 
        especially when added to other inherited terms with thunder attributes, such as *Meldunjaz–*meldo- 
        (from *meldh- 'lightning, hammer', i.e. *Perkwunos' weapon) and *Fergunja–*Fercunyā 
        (from *perkwun-iyā 'wooded mountains', i.e. *Perkwunos' realm).[9]
        Name of the 
        The English weekday name Thursday comes from Old English Þunresdæg, meaning 'day of Þunor', 
        with influence from Old Norse Þórsdagr. The name is cognate with Old High German Donarestag. 
        All of these terms derive from a Late Proto-Germanic weekday name 
        along the lines of *Þunaresdagaz ('Day of *Þun(a)raz'), a calque of Latin Iovis dies ('Day of Jove'; 
        compare modern Italian giovedì, French jeudi, Spanish jueves). By employing a practice known as 
        interpretatio germanica during the Roman period, ancient Germanic peoples adopted the Latin 
        weekly calendar and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own.[12][13]
        Personal names
        Beginning in the Viking Age, personal names containing the theonym Þórr are recorded 
        with great frequency, whereas no examples are known prior to this period. Þórr-based names may 
        have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, 
        similar to the widespread Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.
