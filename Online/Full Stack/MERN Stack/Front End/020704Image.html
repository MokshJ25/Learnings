<!--To add image <img> tag is used. it is a single tag and have no closing tag, and therefore 
no content. we can use many attributes inside it like "src" which is source of the image, it is 
the relative link for the image it has two conditions: 1. put the image in same folder as of code
so you have to write just the name of the image with the extention to make it visible.
2. put the image in other folders but then give the proper address of the directory of that image.
another attribute you can use is "alt" which means alternative. in case of failure or deletion
of the image, you will be able to see this message on the screen at the place of that image.
you can use "height" and "width" attributes also to set the height of the image

in case of absolute link of the image, go on internet, search for the image, select the image,
right click, copy the image address, and paste it in the "src" attribute-->
