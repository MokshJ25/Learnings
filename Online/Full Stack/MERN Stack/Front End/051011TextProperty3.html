    <h1>Iron Man</h1> <hr/>
    <p1>
        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward 
        "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the 
        weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. 
        When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a 
        severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and 
        escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant 
        him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and 
        other abilities. The character was created in response 
        to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable 
        pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been 
        used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man 
        stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as 
        a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel 
        moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the 
        stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, 
        technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, 
        and governmental authority.

    <h2>Publication History</h2><hr/>
    <p2>
        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the 
        subsequent revival of American comic books featuring 
        superheroes, Marvel Comics created new superhero characters. 
        Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.<br> He 
        wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable to 
        his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the 
        character anyway.Iron Man was created in the years after 
        a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and 
        this was incorporated into the character's backstory.The 
        character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam 
        War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam during 
        Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us genuinely felt 
        that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple 
        matter of good versus evil".
