        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward 
        "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the 
        weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. 
        When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a 
        severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and 
        escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant 
        him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and 
        other abilities. The character was created in response 
        to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable 
        pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been 
        used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man 
        stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as 
        a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel 
        moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the 
        stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, 
        technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, 
        and governmental authority.
