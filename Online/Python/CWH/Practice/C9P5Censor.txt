######, ######, walking slow,
Down the lane where breezes ####.
######, ######, ears so high,
Listening close to the birds that fly.

######, ######, strong and stout,
Carrying bundles all about.
######, ######, never in haste,
Step by step, no time to waste.

######, ######, ##### so loud,
Calling out clear to every crowd.
######, ######, humble and sweet,
With steady ###### and patient feet.

######, ######, all day long,
Life with you feels like a song.
######, ######, friend so true,
The world is kinder because of you.
